# Stock Portfolio Application
The Stock Portfolio App is an application that aims to help end users trade stocks and know beforehand the tax implications. This is driven by the "What if" engine which is the crux of the application. It will provide our users the tax implications when trading or buying stocks at the time of the transaction.
